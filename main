# Create a program that asks the user for a number and
# then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.
# (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is,
# it is a number that divides evenly into another number.
# For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)


num = int(input("enter the number to get all it's divisors in range of 100: "))

for i in list1:
    if num%i  == 0:
        divlist.append(i)

print("the divisors of ", num, "are", divlist)


#i am relly noob
#cant even able to solve this simple program
